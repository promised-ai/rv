    Gaussian

## [0.11.0] - 2020-11-20
- Added `_with_cache` variants to `ConjugatePrior` `ln_m` and `ln_pp` methods
    for use cases where these methods are called many times in different data
    without changing the underlying distribution. This also adds two more
    associated types to the trait (`LnMCache` and `LnPpCache`), and one method
    each to compute the caches.
- Remove all references to `serde_derive` crate
- Gaussian process improvements including new kernels

## [0.10.4] - 2020-10-09
- Added Gaussian processes

## [0.10.3] - 2020-10-07
- Updated math in `NormalGamma` and `GaussianSuffStat` to reduce rounding errors

## [0.10.2] - 2020-09-07
- Categorical datum converters work like standard usize-to-boolean casting where
    0 is false, and anything greater than 0 is true.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-08-10
- Add `from_parts_unchecked` method for constructing sufficient statistic since
    there was no way of manipulating statistic's fields or creating them
    manually.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-06-02
- Implement Poisson Mode
- Store `GaussianSuffStat` in a more numerically stable way. The extra numerical
    stability comes at the cost of slower `observe` and `forget`. Serialization
    on `GaussianSuffStat` has changed.

## [0.9.3] - 2020-05-30
- Entropy for Gaussian mixtures more robust to models with dispersed
    low-variance components

- Implement `Mean` for mixtures of distributions that implement `Mean<f64>` or
    `Mean<f32>`

    random numbers.

## [0.9.1] - 2020-05-16
- Remove printlns

## [0.9.0] - 2020-05-16

    `Result<f64, E>`.

- Remove dependency on `quadrature` crate in favor of hand-rolled adaptive
    Simpson's rule, which handles multimodal distributions better.
